        <h3> About Homeloan</h3>
        <p>Buying a home is a once in a lifetime decision for many of us and it would be one of the biggest assets one
            could
            ever make. It is within human nature to forget about the don’ts when there are dos in a particular
            checklist.
            During the home loan availing process</p>
        <h3> Don’t wait for the last minute to come.</h3>

        <p>It is advisable to begin the home loan process six months prior to the property search. Do not prefer opting
            for
            personal loans and credit cards beforehand because your loan application may get rejected if your mortgage
            lender finds more confusion in your CIBIL credit report or in the eligibility related to credit.</p>
